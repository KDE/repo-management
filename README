Two directories are going to be created 'stage' and 'target'. The basic idea
of all this is that stage updates from the remote server and then pushes the 
latest changes to the target repo. Target then runs its post-update hook.
That post-update hook could be anything, included is an example that integrates
into KDE.

Instructions
*Run addrepo.rb while in a directory that you want to clone the repos. 
*Edit the post-update hook
*Then run cronjobbie from a cron job frequently, like */3 minutes.
