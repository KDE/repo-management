Two directories are going to be created 'stage' and 'target'. The basic idea
of all this is that stage updates from the remote server and then pushes the 
latest changes to the target repo. Target then runs its post-update hook.
That update hook could be anything, included is an example that integrates
into KDE.

Instructions
*Run addrepo.rb while in the directory that you want to clone the repos. 
*Edit the update hook as instructed by addrepo.rb
*Edit cronjobbie to chdir into the correct directory
*Then run cronjobbie from a cron job frequently, like */3 minutes.
